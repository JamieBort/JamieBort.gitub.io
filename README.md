# My Portfolio Website

### The Purpose of this README.md file
Unlike most README files on GitHub this one is not meant for you, the public. I am using this for my organization.

To that end, this README file outlines what I plan on doing with my [portfolio website](https://jamiebort.github.io/) as I revamp it.

### Business Requirements

The site shall:

* provide the user with a way to easily find, look at, and download my resume
* allow the user to send me a message via a form that goes into my email inbox, (and maybe texts me?)
* display to the user all of the projects that I wish them to see.
* show my interests as they pertain to my career and technical abilities.
* show off my skills to the user without them having to navigate to my projects.
* display in a graph, chart, or other visual representation my level of skills for each technology.
* follow accessibility standards.
* add content that I create:
  * on my blog. Such as "what I learned today" section,
  * on my LinkedIn account,
  * on my twitter account,
  * etc.
* link to social media sites such as:
  * my LinkedIn profile,
  * my Hackerrank profile (https://www.hackerrank.com/jamiebort),
  * my GitHub profile,
  * etc.
* display my involvement with Devs@rtp and other similar organizations,
* be responsive (works on screens of varying sizes.
* maybe demonstrate my database and backend skills. (alternatively make sure these are demonstrated in my highlighted apps.)

### Functional Requirements

* Use `React.js` and/or `React Native`.
* Header with my name and ... (?)
* Form to contact me.

### Next Steps
1. Figure out my content.
2. Then figure out the layout using Figma.
3. Then build the site.
4. Lastly add content.
