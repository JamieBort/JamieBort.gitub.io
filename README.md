My Portfolio Website

ToDo:

-[ ] 1. What am I involved in and when? (show calendar or neat list)

-[ ] 2. For each link have it open a new tab rather than leave my site.

-[ ] 3. (maybe?) have an image of the resume (large enough to read it as is in case you don't want to download it) to click on to open it in a new tab.

-[ ] 4. Sample coding (same as the resume - large enough to see but clicking on it brings you to the github page)

-[ ] 5. Design idea: simple static landing page linking to more complex, dynamic websites I've created

-[ ] 6. Consult the following for web sites that inspire me:

            a. google docs

            b.
