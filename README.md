notes

<h3>Changes to site below:</h3>
<p>What am I involved in and when? (show calendar or neat list)</p>
<p>For each link have it open a new tab</p>
<p>(maybe?) have an image of the resume (large enough to read it as is in case you don't want to download it) to click on to open it in a new tab.</p>
<p>sample coding (same as the resume - large enough to see but clicking on it brings you to the github page)</p>
<p>include ways to contact me in the summary portion of linkedin.(?)</p>
<p>update 'headline' of liniked in account to be more conprehensive - more detail about me</p>
<p>add portfolio url to linkedin profile</p>
<p>add portfolio url to twitter profile</p>
<p>add portfolio url to medium profile</p>
<p>add portfolio url to github profile</p>
<p>add bio paragraph to github profile</p>
<p>unlock down twitter profile</p>
<p>design idea: simple static landing page linking to more complex, dynamic websites I've created</p>
