My Portfolio Website

ToDo:
-[ ] 1. Add portfolio url to linkedin profile
-[ ] 2. What am I involved in and when? (show calendar or neat list)
-[ ] 3. For each link have it open a new tab rather than leave my site.
-[ ] 4. (maybe?) have an image of the resume (large enough to read it as is in case you don't want to download it) to click on to open it in a new tab.
-[ ] 5. Sample coding (same as the resume - large enough to see but clicking on it brings you to the github page)
-[ ] 6. Include ways to contact me in the summary portion of linkedin.(?)
-[ ] 7. Update 'headline' of liniked in account to be more conprehensive - more detail about me
-[ ] 8. Add portfolio url to twitter profile
-[ ] 9. Add portfolio url to medium profile
-[ ] 10. Add portfolio url to github profile
-[ ] 11. Add bio paragraph to github profile
-[ ] 12. Unlock down twitter profile
-[ ] 13. Design idea: simple static landing page linking to more complex, dynamic websites I've created
