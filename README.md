# My Portfolio Website

Consider scrapping this and starting over.

ToDo:

- [X] 1. For each link have it open a new tab rather than leave my site.
- [X] 2. Hyperlink to phone number for mobile and tablet users.
What am I involved in and when? (show calendar or neat list)
- [ ] 3. ~~(Maybe?) Have an image of the resume (large enough to read it as is in case you don't want to download it) to click on to open it in a new tab.~~
- [ ] 4. Sample coding (same as the resume - large enough to see but clicking on it brings you to the github page)
- [ ] 5. Design idea: simple static landing page linking to more complex, dynamic websites I've created
- [ ] 6. Consult the following for web sites that inspire me:

  a. google docs

  b.

- [ ] 7. Make it correct semantically. So that it is inclusive/web accessable.
- [ ] 8. First build it for mobile users.

  - [X] 8a. For the showcase buttons give the option to load the site or go to the github repo. Use a modal box.

  - [ ] 8b. Update the thumbnail images for the showcased work.

  - [ ] 8c. Update my bio.

  - [X] 8d. Add .DS_Store and other files to the .gitignore file.

  - [X] 8e. Make sure the header background is tall enough for my phone.

  - [X] 8f. Make 'Jamie Bort' fill the width of the header.

  - [X] 8g. Make 'Jamie Bort' and 'Software Engineer' larger.

  - [ ] 8h. Update modal styling. Header? Footer? No header? No footer?

  - [X] 8i. Remove all .DS_Store files from the repository.

  - [X] 8j. Minimize space around buttons.

  - [ ] 8k. Update text in Contact section.

  - [ ] 8l. Update text in Showcase section.

  - [X] 8m. Improve the look of the phone number and email buttons.

  - [ ] 8n. Do I need a copyright in the footer? What do I need down there?.

  - [X] 8o. Address the spacing around the Medium and Currently Reading buttons relative to the three above it. Diminish it.

  - [ ] 8p. The text "Let's connect. He would love to here from you.", "What's currently preoccupying him." and "What he is currently reading." is too small.

  - [ ] 8q. Update the image in the modal so that it fills the dev.

  - [ ] 8r. Style the two links in the modal so they're not at the top of the dev and so that they look better.

  - [ ] 8s. The Meetup button and the phrase 'Triangle Adult Junior Developers' needs to be addressed.


- [ ] 9. Then build it for tablet users.

  - [ ] 9a. [What needs to be addressed here?]
